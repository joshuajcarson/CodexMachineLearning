Program to both create possible moves, do the moves, and store the state of the game at all times.

The program will work in the following ways
* Start a valid game, by picking either 1 or 3 heroes per team, initially only two teams
* Automate the game steps which involve no player involvement, such as discarding and drawging
* Create list of all valid game moves possible from any given game state
* Allow a valid game move to be done and loop back to the previous step
* (Real long term) have AI run the whole thing so there is no need for human involvement
